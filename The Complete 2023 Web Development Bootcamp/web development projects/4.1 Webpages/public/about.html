    <p>Hello, I'm Semih living in Europe. My passion for learning has brought me to the world of programming, and my ultimate goal is to specialize in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
        Before my current path, I completed a Bachelor's degree in Economics and gained 5 years of experience in finance. My desire for self-improvement and lifelong learning has always been a driving force in my life, 
        helping me overcome challenges and broaden my perspective. In my free time, you'll find me exploring new technologies, doing sports, or traveling. My dedication to achieving my goals and my enthusiasm for innovation make me a valuable addition to any team. 
        I'm excited to see what the future holds and how I can collaborate with you guys! </p>
