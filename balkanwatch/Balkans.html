        <h2>About the Balkan Peninsula</h2>
        <p>The Balkan Peninsula is a region in southeastern Europe that comprises several countries. It is known for its rich history, diverse cultures, and scenic landscapes.</p>
        <h3>Balkan Peninsula Countries</h3>
        <p>The term “Balkan Countries”, or simply “The Balkans”, refers to the countries that are located on the Balkan Peninsula, which is situated in southeastern Europe. There is, however, a distinction between what constitutes the Balkan Countries from a geographical perspective and what constitutes them from a political perspective. In terms of geography, the boundaries of the Balkan Peninsula in the north are generally considered to be the Danube and Sava rivers. Thus, from a geographical perspective, the Balkan Peninsula includes most of Slovenia, southeastern Romania, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro, Bulgaria, continental Greece, and the European part of Turkey. In terms of politics, however, Greece and Turkey are normally excluded from the discourse of Balkan affairs.</p>
