        <hr>
        <h3>Escalating Tensions Between Serbia and Kosovo</h3>
        <p>Last week, tensions between Serbia and Kosovo escalated following a police raid by Kosovo in Serb-dominated areas. The raid resulted in the seizure of local municipality buildings and sparked violent clashes between Kosovo's police, NATO-led peacekeepers, and local Serbs. Serbia responded by raising the combat readiness of its troops stationed near the border, sparking fears of a renewal of the 1998-99 conflict in Kosovo. The situation has again fueled fears of a renewal of the conflict in Kosovo that claimed more than 10,000 lives and left more than 1 million homeless.</p>
        <h3>Deadly Storm Sweeps Across the Balkans</h3>
        <p>A powerful storm swept across the Balkans last week, following a heatwave in the region. The storm brought strong winds and heavy rain, resulting in the deaths of at least six people and causing injuries to dozens more in Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia. The storm has caused significant damage and disruption, with emergency services working around the clock to provide relief and assistance to those affected.</p>
        <h3>Serbia Halts Arms Exports</h3>
        <p>In response to the United States imposing sanctions on the Balkan country's intelligence chief over alleged involvement in illegal arms shipment, Serbia's government decided to ban arms export for 30 days. This move is seen as a significant step in addressing the issues of illegal arms trade and ensuring compliance with international regulations.</p>
        <h3>NATO Increases Presence in Kosovo</h3>
        <p>In response to the violent protests in Kosovo, NATO has increased its presence in the region, sending an additional 700 troops to help quell the unrest. Another battalion has been put on standby in case the riots spread. This move by NATO underscores the seriousness of the situation and the commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the region.</p>
        <h3>Deep-Rooted Ethnic Conflict in Kosovo</h3>
        <p>The dispute over Kosovo is centuries old. Serbia considers the region the heart of its statehood and religion. Numerous medieval Serb Orthodox Christian monasteries are in Kosovo. Serb nationalists view a 1389 battle against Ottoman Turks there as a symbol of its national struggle. Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians view Kosovo as their own country and accuse Serbia of occupation and repression. Ethnic Albanian rebels launched a fight to rid the country of Serbian rule in 1998. Belgrade's brutal response prompted a NATO intervention in 1999, which forced Serbia to pull out and cede control to international peacekeepers.</p>
